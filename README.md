# Contact-Management-System
Purpose:
A software program called a Contact Management System (CMS) is made specifically to store, arrange, and manage contact information effectively. It lets users to keep track of all of their contacts—personal or professional—in one place, including names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. CMS improves communication by making contact information easily accessible and making it easier to arrange meetings and follow-ups. 

Scope of Project:
A user-friendly interface for adding, changing, and removing contact information will be designed as part of this project. To find specific connections fast based on a variety of parameters, including name, company, or email, location, address, faculty incharge, phone number the system will consist of search and filter functions. Prioritization will be given to security measures that safeguard sensitive data, such as user authentication and data encryption.

Project Flow:

•	Collect Requirements: Have a meeting with stakeholders to find out how they presently handle employment information and contacts. Determine their requirements and areas of discomfort.
•	Describe the data model: Make a list of all the data you wish to keep, including contact information, appointment schedules, business details, and applicant qualifications.
•	Identification of Entity and Attribute: Divide the data model into its fundamental components, such as Contacts, Companies, Visits, and Candidates. Describe each entity's attributes (information) (e.g., name, email, visit report, resume).
•	Keys & Relationships: Determine the relationships between entities (e.g., a Contact may attend several Visits). Establish a distinct identity (Primary Key) for every table (Contact ID, for example).
•	Design with logic: To represent entities, properties, and relationships visually, create an entity-relationship diagram (ERD).
•	Normalisation: Optimise the design by reducing redundant data and increasing efficiency (e.g., by deleting recurring groupings).
•	Physical Design: Convert the logical model to the particular database platform (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) that you plan to utilise. For every attribute, specify the data type (text, date, etc.).
•	Database Creation: Based on the physical design, create the database structure using the selected platform.
•	Validation and Testing: Add example data to the database and test adding, editing, and retrieving information functions.
•	Documentation: For future reference, keep a record of the whole database design process, including the ERD and data dictionary.
